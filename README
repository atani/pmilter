this version of libmilter is divorced from the rest of sendmail because
holy shit that is the worst build system ever, how about we use some
standardized gnu tools instead?


LICENSE

these sources (.c and .h files) were taken from sendmail-8.15.1, and a copy of
the LICENSE file is included

the original files are present in the commit history of this git project:
  https://github.com/jons/libmilter

if you are not receiving these files from that project, you are not reading
the author's compliance notes, you are reading a copy distributed by someone
else, and i am not liable for their noncompliance

an up-to-date copy of the sendmail license terms should be available here:

NOTES

symlink the appropriate header in include/sm/os/ to sm_os.h, for example:

  sm_os.h -> include/sm/os/sm_os_linux.h


TODO

  make that symlink part of the config process
